## Instagram-based Business Content App
My favorite health and wellness brand is Just Ingredients because they have tier-one education content and their products are fantastic, but I always found myself at a loss when I tried to share content with my friends and family. I would remember seeing it somewhere, but by the time I found it, it was no longer relevant to the conversation/friend. So I made this app make searching and sharing their content easier.

Key Features:
- Text-based search for multi-media inputs
- Education Trivia
